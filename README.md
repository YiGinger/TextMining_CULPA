## This is the repo of data analysis in Project: Data Analysis and Text Mining in CULPA.
[Final Report](https://yiginger.github.io/bubble_cloud/EDAV_YiJiang.html) also includes data visualization products.

(CULPA is a website that allows students to review professors from past classes and to track other's opinions on their potential classes for the next semester.
Using CULPA, students can write a review and comment on professor, course's content, and its workload. Other students have the option of agreeing or disagreeing with a particular review, and deciding whether a review is funny. Students also nominate professors for silver or gold nuggets, which are given to professors by CULPA based on their reviews.)
