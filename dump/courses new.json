Huge-name professors like Ronald Breslow, Thomas Katz, and Gilbert Stork boast an incredible research reputation for the department. This tradition carries over into undergraduate education. Incredibly small major classes (at most 5 students per class) mean a great deal of personal attention and direct interaction with professors. Pretty much all undergrads work directly with a professor on a research project during their junior and senior year. Classes and teaching are also second to none. While the big lectures are a bear and terrible just because of their size, the teachers are well-equipped and it's easy to do well. If you're smart, however, you'll jump the gun and take orgo for freshmen so you can get straight into the upper level classes. Physical Chemistry is a bitch no matter how you look at it, but every grad school class is at most 20 people, and all courses are taught by a professor, not a TA.<br><br>Chemistry is a great department, but you've got to be headstrong and know what you want to get from them - they won't hold your hand going through the process. Start off by getting to know Leonard Fine, the undergrad program advisor, and then get a good relationship with your advisor, whoever that ends up being. If you're into organic, it'll likely be Sames, Leighton, Katz, Breslow, or Danishefsky, or Nuckolls. If you're inorganic, it'll be Norton or Parkin. If you're physical, look into Adams or Valentini. Biophysical, McDermott. There are many options in the department, and wherever you end up, you're a shoe-in for whatever grad school you want (assuming you do well in class and your advisor likes you). Be sure to get an early start though, as you'll be stuck with four full-year courses if you start with general chemistry. Take the placement test and get into orgo for freshmen. From then on you're golden.

Huge-name professors like Ronald Breslow, Thomas Katz, and Gilbert Stork boast an incredible research reputation for the department. This tradition carries over into undergraduate education. Incredibly small major classes (at most 5 students per class) mean a great deal of personal attention and direct interaction with professors. Pretty much all undergrads work directly with a professor on a research project during their junior and senior year. Classes and teaching are also second to none. While the big lectures are a bear and terrible just because of their size, the teachers are well-equipped and it's easy to do well. If you're smart, however, you'll jump the gun and take orgo for freshmen so you can get straight into the upper level classes. Physical Chemistry is a bitch no matter how you look at it, but every grad school class is at most 20 people, and all courses are taught by a professor, not a TA.<br><br>Chemistry is a great department, but you've got to be headstrong and know what you want to get from them - they won't hold your hand going through the process. Start off by getting to know Leonard Fine, the undergrad program advisor, and then get a good relationship with your advisor, whoever that ends up being. If you're into organic, it'll likely be Sames, Leighton, Katz, Breslow, or Danishefsky, or Nuckolls. If you're inorganic, it'll be Norton or Parkin. If you're physical, look into Adams or Valentini. Biophysical, McDermott. There are many options in the department, and wherever you end up, you're a shoe-in for whatever grad school you want (assuming you do well in class and your advisor likes you). Be sure to get an early start though, as you'll be stuck with four full-year courses if you start with general chemistry. Take the placement test and get into orgo for freshmen. From then on you're golden.

Huge-name professors like Ronald Breslow, Thomas Katz, and Gilbert Stork boast an incredible research reputation for the department. This tradition carries over into undergraduate education. Incredibly small major classes (at most 5 students per class) mean a great deal of personal attention and direct interaction with professors. Pretty much all undergrads work directly with a professor on a research project during their junior and senior year. Classes and teaching are also second to none. While the big lectures are a bear and terrible just because of their size, the teachers are well-equipped and it's easy to do well. If you're smart, however, you'll jump the gun and take orgo for freshmen so you can get straight into the upper level classes. Physical Chemistry is a bitch no matter how you look at it, but every grad school class is at most 20 people, and all courses are taught by a professor, not a TA.<br><br>Chemistry is a great department, but you've got to be headstrong and know what you want to get from them - they won't hold your hand going through the process. Start off by getting to know Leonard Fine, the undergrad program advisor, and then get a good relationship with your advisor, whoever that ends up being. If you're into organic, it'll likely be Sames, Leighton, Katz, Breslow, or Danishefsky, or Nuckolls. If you're inorganic, it'll be Norton or Parkin. If you're physical, look into Adams or Valentini. Biophysical, McDermott. There are many options in the department, and wherever you end up, you're a shoe-in for whatever grad school you want (assuming you do well in class and your advisor likes you). Be sure to get an early start though, as you'll be stuck with four full-year courses if you start with general chemistry. Take the placement test and get into orgo for freshmen. From then on you're golden. Oh yeah, get to know Socky and Daisy, the undergraduate office staffers - they'll save your life more than once while you're there.", "nickname": "chem + chem eng", "name": "Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}], "reviews": [2456], "id": 952},{"core": 0, "name": "Fund. of Western Music", "number": null, "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "music", "name": "Music"}], "reviews": [2460, 24158, 25146, 25761], "id": 954},{"core": 0, "name": "Religion in Chinese Society", "number": "ANTH V3035", "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "anthropology", "name": "Anthropology"}], "reviews": [2466, 3027], "id": 955},{"core": 0, "name": "Race and Ethnicity in American Politics", "number": "POLS W3245", "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "poli sci", "name": "Political Science"}], "reviews": [436, 2463, 2805, 3365, 3986, 5791, 8689, 8830, 11509, 11734, 11968, 12084, 12106, 12137, 12266, 12358, 13896, 15399, 16654, 16956, 18004, 18072, 20770, 20832, 21243, 27500, 27621], "id": 956},{"core": 0, "name": "Ear-Training", "number": null, "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "music", "name": "Music"}], "reviews": [2473, 5491, 5518, 5942], "id": 957},{"core": 0, "name": "A Social History of Columbia University", "number": "HIST BC3457", "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "history", "name": "History"}], "reviews": [2476, 4847, 9507, 9719, 10127], "id": 959},{"core": 0, "name": "Russian Lit: The Avant Garde and Revolution", "number": null, "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "slavic languages", "name": "Slavic Languages"}], "reviews": [2477], "id": 960},{"core": 0, "name": "History of Roman Empire", "number": null, "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "history", "name": "History"}], "reviews": [2479], "id": 962},{"core": 0, "name": "Harmony and Counterpoint (Diatonic/Chromatic)", "number": null, "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "music", "name": "Music"}], "reviews": [2480, 25997], "id": 963},{"core": 0, "name": "Memorials & Collective Memory", "number": "ANTH V3981", "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "anthropology", "name": "Anthropology"}], "reviews": [2482], "id": 964},{"core": 0, "name": "Environmental Hazards and Disasters", "number": null, "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "ees", "name": "Earth and Environmental Science"}], "reviews": [2485, 13142], "id": 966},{"core": 0, "name": "The Social World", "number": "SOCI W1000", "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "sociology", "name": "Sociology"}], "reviews": [23458, 23527, 23812, 23828, 23976, 24104, 24171, 24329, 24337, 24435, 24676, 24807, 25039, 25179, 25306, 25331, 25718, 25937, 26027, 26466, 26492, 26725, 27374, 27669, 27801, 28218, 28949], "id": 5518},{"core": 0, "name": "Perception and Language", "number": "PSYC BC3164", "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "psych", "name": "Psychology"}], "reviews": [2494], "id": 972},{"core": 0, "name": "German I", "number": null, "departments": [{"header": "", "nickname": "germanic lang + lit", "name": "Germanic Languages and Literature  "}], "reviews": [6527, 9845], "id": 974},{"core": 0, "name": "Intermediate Microeconomics", "number": "BC3035", "departments": [{"header": "As an econ major, you can kiss the university's vaunted  student-teacher ratio goodbye because you will never, ever see it  borne out in reality -- not even in seminars.

Huge-name professors like Ronald Breslow, Thomas Katz, and Gilbert Stork boast an incredible research reputation for the department. This tradition carries over into undergraduate education. Incredibly small major classes (at most 5 students per class) mean a great deal of personal attention and direct interaction with professors. Pretty much all undergrads work directly with a professor on a research project during their junior and senior year. Classes and teaching are also second to none. While the big lectures are a bear and terrible just because of their size, the teachers are well-equipped and it's easy to do well. If you're smart, however, you'll jump the gun and take orgo for freshmen so you can get straight into the upper level classes. Physical Chemistry is a bitch no matter how you look at it, but every grad school class is at most 20 people, and all courses are taught by a professor, not a TA.<br><br>Chemistry is a great department, but you've got to be headstrong and know what you want to get from them - they won't hold your hand going through the process. Start off by getting to know Leonard Fine, the undergrad program advisor, and then get a good relationship with your advisor, whoever that ends up being. If you're into organic, it'll likely be Sames, Leighton, Katz, Breslow, or Danishefsky, or Nuckolls. If you're inorganic, it'll be Norton or Parkin. If you're physical, look into Adams or Valentini. Biophysical, McDermott. There are many options in the department, and wherever you end up, you're a shoe-in for whatever grad school you want (assuming you do well in class and your advisor likes you).

Huge-name professors like Ronald Breslow, Thomas Katz, and Gilbert Stork boast an incredible research reputation for the department. This tradition carries over into undergraduate education. Incredibly small major classes (at most 5 students per class) mean a great deal of personal attention and direct interaction with professors. Pretty much all undergrads work directly with a professor on a research project during their junior and senior year. Classes and teaching are also second to none. While the big lectures are a bear and terrible just because of their size, the teachers are well-equipped and it's easy to do well. If you're smart, however, you'll jump the gun and take orgo for freshmen so you can get straight into the upper level classes. Physical Chemistry is a bitch no matter how you look at it, but every grad school class is at most 20 people, and all courses are taught by a professor, not a TA.<br><br>Chemistry is a great department, but you've got to be headstrong and know what you want to get from them - they won't hold your hand going through the process.

Huge-name professors like Ronald Breslow, Thomas Katz, and Gilbert Stork boast an incredible research reputation for the department. This tradition carries over into undergraduate education. Incredibly small major classes (at most 5 students per class) mean a great deal of personal attention and direct interaction with professors. Pretty much all undergrads work directly with a professor on a research project during their junior and senior year. Classes and teaching are also second to none. While the big lectures are a bear and terrible just because of their size, the teachers are well-equipped and it's easy to do well. If you're smart, however, you'll jump the gun and take orgo for freshmen so you can get straight into the upper level classes. Physical Chemistry is a bitch no matter how you look at it, but every grad school class is at most 20 people, and all courses are taught by a professor, not a TA.<br><br>Chemistry is a great department, but you've got to be headstrong and know what you want to get from them - they won't hold your hand going through the process. Start off by getting to know Leonard Fine, the undergrad program advisor, and then get a good relationship with your advisor, whoever that ends up being. If you're into organic, it'll likely be Sames, Leighton, Katz, Breslow, or Danishefsky, or Nuckolls. If you're inorganic, it'll be Norton or Parkin. If you're physical, look into Adams or Valentini. Biophysical, McDermott. There are many options in the department, and wherever you end up, you're a shoe-in for whatever grad school you want (assuming you do well in class and your advisor likes you). Be sure to get an early start though, as you'll be stuck with four full-year courses if you start with general chemistry. Take the placement test and get into orgo for freshmen.

Huge-name professors like Ronald Breslow, Thomas Katz, and Gilbert Stork boast an incredible research reputation for the department. This tradition carries over into undergraduate education. Incredibly small major classes (at most 5 students per class) mean a great deal of personal attention and direct interaction with professors. Pretty much all undergrads work directly with a professor on a research project during their junior and senior year. Classes and teaching are also second to none. While the big lectures are a bear and terrible just because of their size, the teachers are well-equipped and it's easy to do well. If you're smart, however, you'll jump the gun and take orgo for freshmen so you can get straight into the upper level classes. Physical Chemistry is a bitch no matter how you look at it, but every grad school class is at most 20 people, and all courses are taught by a professor, not a TA.<br><br>Chemistry is a great department, but you've got to be headstrong and know what you want to get from them - they won't hold your hand going through the process. Start off by getting to know Leonard Fine, the undergrad program advisor, and then get a good relationship with your advisor, whoever that ends up being. If you're into organic, it'll likely be Sames, Leighton, Katz, Breslow, or Danishefsky, or Nuckolls. If you're inorganic, it'll be Norton or Parkin. If you're physical, look into Adams or Valentini.

Huge-name professors like Ronald Breslow, Thomas Katz, and Gilbert Stork boast an incredible research reputation for the department. This tradition carries over into undergraduate education. Incredibly small major classes (at most 5 students per class) mean a great deal of personal attention and direct interaction with professors. Pretty much all undergrads work directly with a professor on a research project during their junior and senior year. Classes and teaching are also second to none. While the big lectures are a bear and terrible just because of their size, the teachers are well-equipped and it's easy to do well. If you're smart, however, you'll jump the gun and take orgo for freshmen so you can get straight into the upper level classes. Physical Chemistry is a bitch no matter how you look at it, but every grad school class is at most 20 people, and all courses are taught by a professor, not a TA.<br><br>Chemistry is a great department, but you've got to be headstrong and know what you want to get from them - they won't hold your hand going through the process. Start off by getting to know Leonard Fine, the undergrad program advisor, and then get a good relationship with your advisor, whoever that ends up being. If you're into organic, it'll likely be Sames, Leighton, Katz, Breslow, or Danishefsky, or Nuckolls. If you're inorganic, it'll be Norton or Parkin. If you're physical, look into Adams or Valentini. Biophysical, McDermott. There are many options in the department, and wherever you end up, you're a shoe-in for whatever grad school you want (assuming you do well in class and your advisor likes you). Be sure to get an early start though, as you'll be stuck with four full-year courses if you start with general chemistry. Take the placement test and get into orgo for freshmen. From then on you're golden.

well-known as one of the best in the world. Huge-name professors like Ronald Breslow, Thomas Katz, and Gilbert Stork boast an incredible research reputation for the department. This tradition carries over into undergraduate education. Incredibly small major classes (at most 5 students per class) mean a great deal of personal attention and direct interaction with professors. Pretty much all undergrads work directly with a professor on a research project during their junior and senior year. Classes and teaching are also second to none. While the big lectures are a bear and terrible just because of their size, the teachers are well-equipped and it's easy to do well. If you're smart, however, you'll jump the gun and take orgo for freshmen so you can get straight into the upper level classes. Physical Chemistry is a bitch no matter how you look at it, but every grad school class is at most 20 people, and all courses are taught by a professor, not a TA.<br><br>Chemistry is a great department, but you've got to be headstrong and know what you want to get from them - they won't hold your hand going through the process. Start off by getting to know Leonard Fine, the undergrad program advisor, and then get a good relationship with your advisor, whoever that ends up being. If you're into organic, it'll likely be Sames, Leighton, Katz, Breslow, or Danishefsky, or Nuckolls. If you're inorganic, it'll be Norton or Parkin. If you're physical, look into Adams or Valentini. Biophysical, McDermott. There are many options in the department, and wherever you end up, you're a shoe-in for whatever grad school you want (assuming you do well in class and your advisor likes you). Be sure to get an early start though, as you'll be stuck with four full-year courses if you start with general chemistry. Take the placement test and get into orgo for freshmen. From then on you're golden.
